# Riot-API-Challenge-2
My submission for the item set division of the Riot API challenge 2

Itemsetup is a website that analyzes a summoner's ranked games, and generates a corrusponding itemset. The algorithm
is specifically set up to not omit alternate build paths. Due to this design decision, all purchased jungle items
and boots will show up somewhere in the item set.

This website is especially valuable when learning a new champion. If you want to learn Ekko, for example, you can download C9 Hai's ranked games and turn them into an itemset. Now the burden of figuring out how to itemize has been lifted.
