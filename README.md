# Riot-API-Challenge-2
My submission for the item set division of the Riot API challenge 2

Itemsetup is a website that analyzes a summoner's ranked games, and generates a corrusponding itemset. The algorithm
is specifically set up to not omit alternate build paths. Due to this design decision, all purchased jungle items
and boots will show up somewhere in the item set.

Technologies Used:
----
* Flask
* is.js
* Angular.js
* Bootstrap
* Angular.js bootstrap plugin
* jQuery
* fileSaver.js
